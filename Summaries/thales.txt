Thales of Miletus (c. 624–546 BCE) is often regarded as the first philosopher in the Western tradition. Hailing from the ancient city of Miletus in Ionia (modern-day Turkey), Thales is best remembered for pioneering a shift from mythological explanations of the world to rational, systematic inquiry. He was not just a philosopher but also a mathematician and astronomer, and his multifaceted contributions laid the groundwork for subsequent thinkers.

One of Thales’ most celebrated beliefs was that water is the fundamental underlying substance, or arche, of the universe. He posited that everything originated from water and would return to it, seeking to identify a single principle underlying the diverse phenomena in nature. While this might seem rudimentary by today's standards, Thales' emphasis on a single, natural principle was a revolutionary step away from attributing natural events to the whims of deities.

In mathematics, Thales left an indelible mark with theorems that are still taught today. The most famous among these is "Thales’ Theorem," which posits that any angle inscribed in a semicircle is a right angle. His interest in geometry, particularly in the properties of circles and triangles, was likely influenced by his travels to Egypt, where such knowledge was crucial for land surveying.

Thales also exhibited his prowess in astronomy. He is credited with successfully predicting a solar eclipse around 585 BCE, an event that notably halted a battle between the Medes and the Lydians when it was interpreted as a divine omen. Such predictions bolstered his reputation, demonstrating the practical applications of philosophical and astronomical knowledge.

Thales' significance lies not just in his specific theories or predictions, but in his methodological approach. He championed the idea that natural phenomena could be explained by rational principles, paving the way for subsequent Ionian thinkers and the broader tradition of Western philosophy and science. While many of his ideas have been surpassed or refined, his foundational role in the birth of critical inquiry remains undisputed.
