Socrates (469–399 BCE) stands as one of the foundational figures in Western philosophy. Unlike many of his contemporaries, he didn't leave behind any writings; hence, our understanding of his teachings and methods primarily comes from his students, most notably Plato and Xenophon. Socrates is best known for his Socratic method—a form of dialectical questioning aimed at stimulating critical thinking and exposing contradictions in one's beliefs.

Central to Socratic philosophy is the pursuit of virtue and wisdom. Socrates believed that no one commits wrongdoing knowingly and that any act of wrongdoing arises from ignorance. This led to his famous assertion: "An unexamined life is not worth living." For Socrates, the process of self-examination, questioning, and seeking knowledge was paramount to a virtuous life. This commitment to inner integrity and conscience was later to be the cause of his trial and execution.

The Socratic method, or elenchus, was his way of seeking the truth. Through a series of questions, Socrates would lead his interlocutors to recognize the inconsistencies or inadequacies in their beliefs. This wasn't just a method to refute others; it was a mutual journey toward better understanding. Plato's dialogues often depict Socrates in these philosophical discussions, navigating various topics, from justice and beauty to piety and love.

Socrates' commitment to personal integrity and his willingness to question Athenian norms made him many adversaries. His criticisms of traditional beliefs and the Athenian democracy eventually led to his trial in 399 BCE, where he was charged with corrupting the youth and impiety. Defiant till the end, Socrates used his trial as another opportunity to espouse his philosophies, leading to his conviction and subsequent execution by drinking hemlock.

Despite the absence of personal writings, Socrates' profound impact on Western thought is indisputable. His teachings, primarily through Plato's works, laid the groundwork for numerous philosophical movements, including the schools of Cynicism, Skepticism, and Stoicism. His life and philosophy continue to serve as a testament to the value of critical thought and the pursuit of wisdom in the face of societal pressures.
